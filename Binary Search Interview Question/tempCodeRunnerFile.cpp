// if you are given a sorted array and a target element for e.g
// arr = [2,3,5,9,14,16,18] and target = 15 
// you have to return ceil and floor value of target
// ceil is a value >= target 
// floot is a value <= target 
// we will use binary search for this question ? why ?
/* 

1 WE WANT TO FIND THE NUMBER
2 IT IS A SORTED ARRAY
3 WE ALWAYS GET 2 VALUES HIGH AND LOW WHICH IS GREATER THAN OR LESS THAN ANSWER
